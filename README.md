# Maze-3D-Shooter
A simple maze solving game with enemies. You spawn in a small labyrinth and you need to avoid enemies that survey the area around some blocks.
Be careful as enemy collision will result in your health going down. The clock is also ticking, as you only have a limited amount of time before you fail the level, you must escape before the timer bar disappears. Global illumination and light sources are also implemented, the further you will travel into the maze, the darker it will get until you manage to exit.

The maze is chosen random from 5 different maps, so you won't repeat the same pattern everytime.

Use WASD to move, left CTRL to change from third person to first person and vice versa, left click to shoot and try to get out!

~~ Made with GFX Framework
